Q1 : Why didn't we use sudo before node lab.js in this case?
	We didn't use sudo because running node lab.js only needs 
	user-level permissions. sudo is only needed for commands 
	that require administrator (root) rights.

Q2 : What does lab.js do?
	It reads the contents of plain.txt and prints it to the terminal.

Q3 : Why does *************after readFile*****************
appear before the contents of plain.txt in the output while the call to 
readFile is before the console.log call that prints this line?
	Because fs.readFile in Node.js is asynchronous. Which means Node 
	doesn't wait for the file reading to finish before moving on to 
	the next line. so console.log("after readFile") runs first, and then
	once the file is done reading, Node prints its contents.

Q4 : What does the function toString('utf8') do?
	It converts the raw byte buffer (numbers representing characters)
	into a human-readable string using the UTF-8 encoding. Without it, 
	Node prints the raw byte values (numbers).
